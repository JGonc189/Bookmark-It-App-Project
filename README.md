# Bookmark It! #

This app was built with vanilla JS and HTML5 Local Storage.  The app allows the user to type in a website and then save it for a future reference. 
The user can delete or add new sites when ever he or she wants.
Sites will be saved even after you exit the app.  Bookmarked information from the app will be saved onto Local Storage.
